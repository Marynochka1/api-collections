# QA Manual API Portfolio

This repository contains a Postman collection for manual API testing as part of a QA portfolio. It demonstrates skills in API testing, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, along with validation of responses.

## Collection Overview

- **GET**: Retrieves data (e.g., list of users or products).
- **POST**: Creates new entries (e.g., add a new user).
- **PUT/PATCH**: Updates existing entries.
- **DELETE**: Removes entries from the system.

Each request includes basic tests for:
- **Status code validation** (e.g., checking for `200 OK`)
- **Response time** (e.g., under 500ms)
- **Data structure validation** (e.g., expected fields are present)
